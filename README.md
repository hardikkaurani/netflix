# 🎬 Netflix Clone  

Hey there! 👋  
This is my project where I tried to recreate a **Netflix-like landing page** using **HTML & CSS**.  
I built it to practice **frontend skills** like layout design, styling, and responsiveness while making something fun and familiar.  


## 🚀 What’s inside?  
- 🍿 Netflix-inspired homepage design  
- 📱 Responsive layout (works smoothly on desktop & mobile)  
- ⚡ Built only with **HTML & CSS** (no frameworks yet)  


## 📂 Project Files  
- **index.html** → Main HTML structure  
- **styles.css** → All the Netflix-style design & styling  


## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser  
3. Enjoy the Netflix-like UI 🎥  


## 💡 Why I made this  
Netflix has one of the cleanest and most attractive UIs.  
I wanted to challenge myself by trying to recreate it using just **HTML & CSS**.  
This project helped me practice **flexbox, grid, and responsive web design concepts**.  


## 🔮 What’s next?  
This is just a starting point 🚀  
- Adding **JavaScript** for interactive features (like sliders & play buttons)  
- Creating a **login page & sign-up form**  
- Maybe even connecting it with a **movie API** to display real data 🎞️
  

## 🙌 Final Words  
This project was a great way to improve my frontend skills while cloning something cool.  
I’ll keep upgrading it step by step. If you have suggestions, feel free to share!
